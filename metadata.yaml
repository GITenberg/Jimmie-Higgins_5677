description: Sinclair wrote Jimmie Higgins in response to the First World War. He
  broke with the main body of the American Socialist Party at that time, favoring
  U.S. involvement in WWI, because of the threat of German militarism. After the war,
  however, he opposed any interference to the developing Bolshevik regime in Moscow.
  The title character of Jimmie Higgins enlists in the army and fights bravely, but
  is tortured into madness following the war, for espousing the same policies as did
  Sinclair himself.
